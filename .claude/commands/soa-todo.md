# Document the next ISO 27001 control

I need to help you document the next unchecked ISO 27001 control from the Statement of Applicability (SoA).

First, let me check the progress tracker to identify which control to work on.

$ARGUMENTS

## Approach

I will:
1. Identify the next unchecked control (or use the specified control if provided)
2. Ask detailed questions to gather accurate information about:
   - Whether the control is applicable to Jiki
   - Current implementation status
   - Who owns/is responsible for this control
   - How it is (or will be) implemented
   - What evidence exists
   - Related risks
   - Any gaps or issues

## Important principles:
- **Accuracy over assumptions** - I will ask for specific information rather than guessing
- **Evidence-based** - I will request references to actual documents, systems, or processes
- **Clear status** - I will help determine if the control is Not Implemented, In Progress, or Implemented
- **Justification** - If a control is not applicable, I will help document why

I will then update the appropriate control documentation file and mark the control as complete in progress.md.
