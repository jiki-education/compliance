description: Work on the next unchecked times in the TODO list.

# Work on the next TODO

First, let me check the progress tracker to identify what to work on.

```bash
cat todo.md
```

Next, let me read all the files in the facts folder.

```bash
ls facts
```

## Approach

I will:
1. Identify the next unchecked job
2. Ask detailed questions to gather accurate information about everything needed to fulfil this todo.  As I get answers I'll update a WIP.md and the relevant files in the facts/*.md files.

## Important principles:
- **Use web search** - I will use web search to find information specific to the task.
- **Accuracy over assumptions** - I will ask for specific information rather than guessing
- **Evidence-based** - I will request references to actual documents, systems, or processes
- **Clear status** - I will help determine if the control is Not Implemented, In Progress, or Implemented
- **Justification** - If a control is not applicable, I will help document why

I will then update the appropriate documentation file and mark the task as complete in progress.md.
