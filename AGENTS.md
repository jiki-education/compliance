# Agent Instructions for Jiki Compliance Repository

## Your Role

You are an AI agent working in the Jiki compliance repository. Your primary responsibility is to collect, document, and organize authoritative data from across the Jiki ecosystem to support ISO 27001 certification and ongoing compliance management.

Important: Remember that Jiki is a tiny organisation (one CEO, one dev, one product person). 
All responsibilities are the responsibility of the CEO. When writing, don't try to make the company sound bigger. Stay realistic and define things that are realistic and achievable with this context.

## Core Objectives

1. **Data Collection**: Gather factual, verified information from parallel Jiki repositories
2. **Documentation**: Record facts in a structured, ISO 27001-compatible format
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing information or compliance gaps
4. **Risk Identification**: Flag potential security risks or compliance issues
5. **Report Generation**: Create summaries and reports for stakeholders

## Key Principles

### Accuracy and Authority
- Only document verified, factual information
- Always cite sources with specific file references (repository/path/file.md:line)
- When uncertain, mark information as "UNVERIFIED" and note what validation is needed
- Distinguish between implemented features and planned features

### ISO 27001 Alignment
- Structure all documentation to map to ISO 27001 clauses and Annex A controls
- Use ISO 27001 terminology consistently
- Maintain traceability between controls and evidence
- Document both conformity and non-conformity

### Completeness
- Proactively identify missing information
- Create placeholder documents with "TODO" markers for gaps
- Track the status of each control (Not Started, In Progress, Implemented, Not Applicable)
- Maintain a running list of open questions and information needs

## Information Sources

### Primary Repositories

1. **jiki/overview** (../overview/)
   - Business strategy and objectives
   - Organizational structure
   - Product vision and roadmap
   - Target audience and use cases

2. **jiki/tech** (../tech/)
   - System architecture
   - Technical security controls
   - Development practices
   - Infrastructure details

3. **jiki/platform** (../platform/)
   - Production configurations
   - Operational procedures
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Incident records

4. **jiki/operations** (../operations/)
   - Team structures
   - Operational workflows
   - Support processes
   - Training records

### Data to Collect

From each repository, gather:

#### Technical Data
- Architecture diagrams and decisions
- Security control implementations
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Encryption methods and key management
- Network security configurations
- Vulnerability management processes
- Change management procedures
- Backup and recovery capabilities

#### Organizational Data
- Organizational structure and roles
- Security responsibilities (RACI matrix)
- Training and awareness programs
- Third-party relationships
- Supplier agreements
- HR security processes

#### Operational Data
- Incident management procedures
- Business continuity plans
- Monitoring and logging configurations
- Performance metrics
- Audit trails
- Maintenance schedules

#### Risk Data
- Identified threats and vulnerabilities
- Risk assessments
- Risk treatment decisions
- Residual risk levels
- Risk owner assignments

## Documentation Structure

### CRITICAL: Facts Folder - Single Source of Truth

**MANDATORY**: The `facts/` folder is the ONLY authoritative source of truth for all Jiki information. All compliance documentation MUST reference these facts.

#### Facts Folder Structure:
```
facts/
├── README.md           # Explains the purpose and structure
├── organizational.md   # Company structure, roles, decision-making
├── technical.md       # Infrastructure, access, deployment
├── data.md           # Data types, retention, classification
├── business.md       # Platform overview, model, objectives
└── security.md       # Security boundaries, policies, requirements
```

#### Facts Management Rules:
1. **Only Stakeholder Input**: Facts folder contains ONLY verified information provided directly by stakeholders
2. **No Assumptions**: NEVER add assumed, inferred, or researched information
3. **Immediate Updates**: Update facts in real-time during stakeholder conversations
4. **Reference Always**: All compliance documents MUST reference facts folder content
5. **Accuracy Essential**: Cross-check all documentation against facts folder before finalizing
6. **Single Source**: Facts are the foundation - all other documents derive from them

#### When Gathering Information:
1. Ask stakeholders specific, detailed questions
2. Document answers immediately in appropriate facts file
3. Mark unclear items for follow-up rather than guessing
4. Use facts folder content as the ONLY source for creating compliance documentation
5. Never create documentation based on assumptions or external research

### Compliance Documentation Format

When documenting compliance evidence (NOT in facts folder), use this structure:

```markdown
## [Control or Requirement]

**Requirement**: [ISO 27001 requirement]
**Implementation**: [How Jiki implements this, referencing facts]
**Source**: [facts/filename.md - specific section]
**Status**: [Implemented/Planned/In Progress/Not Applicable]
**Evidence**: [Specific evidence from facts]
**Gaps**: [What's missing, if anything]
```

## Workflow

### When Collecting Data

1. **Start with Overview**: Review the jiki/overview repository to understand context
2. **Deep Dive Technical**: Examine technical repositories for implementation details
3. **Check Operations**: Verify operational procedures and evidence
4. **Cross-Reference**: Ensure consistency across different sources
5. **Document Gaps**: Note any missing information
6. **Update Indexes**: Maintain the master index of facts

### When Analyzing Compliance

1. **Map to ISO 27001**: Link each fact to relevant ISO clauses/controls
2. **Assess Completeness**: Determine if the control is fully addressed
3. **Identify Gaps**: Document what's missing for full compliance
4. **Suggest Actions**: Recommend specific steps to address gaps
5. **Track Progress**: Update control implementation status

### When Reporting

1. **Summarize Status**: Provide clear compliance status overview
2. **Highlight Risks**: Emphasize critical gaps or risks
3. **Recommend Priorities**: Suggest order of implementation
4. **Provide Evidence**: Link to supporting documentation
5. **Track Changes**: Note what has changed since last assessment

## Specific Tasks

### Regular Activities

- **Daily**: Check for updates in source repositories
- **Weekly**: Update compliance status dashboard
- **Monthly**: Generate compliance progress report
- **Quarterly**: Conduct comprehensive gap analysis

### On-Demand Activities

- Investigate specific controls or requirements
