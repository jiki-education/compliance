## Template Instructions

When documenting a control:

1. **Be Factual**: Only document what actually exists or is definitively planned
2. **Be Specific**: Avoid vague statements; include specific tools, systems, and processes
3. **Use References**: Link to actual evidence in Jiki repositories where possible
4. **Mark Unknowns**: Use "TBD" or "TODO" for information that needs to be gathered
5. **Maintain Consistency**: Follow this template structure for all controls
6. **Update Regularly**: Review and update status as implementation progresses
7. **Cross-Reference**: Link to related controls, risks, and evidence

### Status Definitions

- **Not Implemented**: Control has not been addressed at all
- **In Progress**: Implementation is underway but not complete
- **Implemented**: Control is fully operational with evidence
- **Not Applicable**: Control does not apply to Jiki (requires justification)
