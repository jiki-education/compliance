# ISO 27001 Summary for Jiki

## What is ISO 27001?

ISO 27001 is an international standard for information security management. It provides a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information so that it remains secure. It includes people, processes, and IT systems by applying a risk management process.

## Key Components Required for ISO 27001 Certification

- **Risk-Based Approach**: Identify, assess, and treat information security risks systematically

### 2. Leadership and Commitment

Senior management must demonstrate active involvement:

- **Management Commitment**: Leadership must actively support and resource the ISMS
- **Security Roles**: Define clear roles and responsibilities for information security

### 3. Risk Assessment and Treatment

A systematic approach to managing security risks:

- **Risk Assessment Methodology**: Document how you identify and evaluate risks
